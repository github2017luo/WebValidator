# WebValidator

Simple validation tools that scans the given domain, for URL and then checks for possible errors (error statuses like 500, 404 etc.).
Results are saved as JSON file. The UI is being made.

Current version supports only command line usage and validation of purely HTML pages. Pages heavily dependent on JavaScript will not be properly validated (this will be addressed in the future)


It is a college project. that still needs a lot of improvements, but it is usable at the moment.
