# WebValidator

Simple validation tools that scans the gived domain, for URL and then checks for possible errors (error statuses like 500, 404 etc.).
Results are saved as JSON file. The UI is beeing made.

Current version supports only command line usage and validation of purely HTML pages. Pages heavlly dependant on JavaScript will not be properly validated.
